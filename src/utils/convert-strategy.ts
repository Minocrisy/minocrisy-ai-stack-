CURRENT ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS

1. YOGI (Node.js Server)
- Main server application
- Public and uploads handling
- API integrations

2. yogi-ui (React/Vite)
Components:
- HistoryManager
- ImageGenerator
- ModelPanel
- ModelSelector
- TextToSpeechGenerator
- Navbar

3. yogicast (Flutter)
- Podcast generation features
- Media playback controls

4. tellet (Flutter)
Services:
- speech_service.dart
- video_service.dart

5. yogi-engineer (Python)
- CLI-based development tools
- Ollama integration

CONSOLIDATION PLAN

1. SHARED SERVICES LAYER (services_001)
Priority: High
Status: Pending

Components to Migrate:
- Speech and video services from tellet
- API integrations from YOGI
- Model management from yogi-ui
- Media services standardization

Steps:
1. Create unified API integration layer
2. Standardize media service interfaces
3. Implement shared model management
4. Migrate existing services

2. UI COMPONENTS MIGRATION (ui_001)
Priority: High
Status: In Progress

Components to Migrate:
- Base components from YOGI
- AI components from yogi-ui
- Media controls from yogicast
- Character creation interface

Steps:
1. Define component standards
2. Migrate base components
3. Integrate AI-specific components
4. Add media control interfaces
5. Implement character creation UI

3. CONTENT CREATION FEATURES (content_001)
Priority: Medium
Status: Pending

Features to Integrate:
- Podcast generation (yogicast)
- Video processing (tellet)
- Character creation workflow

Steps:
1. Define content creation interfaces
2. Migrate podcast generation
3. Integrate video processing
4. Implement character creation logic

4. DEVELOPMENT TOOLS (tools_001)
Priority: Low
Status: Pending

Tools to Integrate:
- CLI capabilities from yogi-engineer
- Code analysis features
- Project management tools

Steps:
1. Port CLI functionality
2. Implement code analysis
3. Add project management features

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

1. Repository Structure
- Maintain separate repositories
- Use shared dependencies
- Implement consistent versioning

2. Technology Standardization
- Frontend: React/Vite
- Backend: Node.js
- Services: REST/GraphQL APIs
- Development Tools: TypeScript/Python

3. Migration Process
- Start with shared services
- Migrate UI components
- Integrate content features
- Add development tools
- Maintain compatibility

4. Documentation Requirements
- Architecture documentation
- API specifications
- Component usage guides
- Migration guides

PROGRESS TRACKING

Completed:
- ✓ Initial architecture analysis
- ✓ Consolidation strategy documentation

In Progress:
- Base UI components migration
- Component standardization

Pending:
- Shared services implementation
- Content creation integration
- Development tools migration

NEXT STEPS

1. Begin shared services layer implementation
2. Continue UI component migration
3. Plan content creation feature integration
4. Prepare development tools migration plan

This strategy provides a structured approach to consolidating the Yogi ecosystem while maintaining functionality and improving maintainability.`;
