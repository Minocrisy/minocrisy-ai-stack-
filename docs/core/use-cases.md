   Example: An agency can use our system to build multiple AI chatbots for different clients, each with unique branding but consistent quality.

3. Enterprise Teams
   Problem: Need to maintain standards across departments
   Solution:
   - Share development environment
   - Enforce best practices
   - Control versions
   Example: A large company can use our system to ensure all internal AI tools follow the same patterns and quality standards.

TECHNICAL USE CASES

1. AI Integration Projects
   Problem: Complex API integrations
   Solution:
   - Pre-built API interfaces
   - Type-safe templates
   - Example implementations
   Example:
   ```typescript
   // Import base interface
   import { GroqAPI } from './types';

   // Implement with your logic
   class MyAIService implements GroqAPI {
     // Types and methods ready to use
   }
   ```

2. UI Development
   Problem: Building consistent interfaces
   Solution:
   - Base component library
   - Styling system
   - Interactive examples
   Example:
   ```typescript
   // Import base components
   import { Button, Card } from './ui';

   // Create your feature
   const AIFeature = () => (
     <Card>
       <Button variant="primary">
         Generate
       </Button>
     </Card>
   );
   ```

3. Documentation Projects
   Problem: Keeping docs updated
   Solution:
   - Automated conversion
   - Consistent formatting
   - Version control
   Example:
   ```bash
   # Convert all project docs
   npm run docs:convert

   # Result: Markdown files with proper formatting
   ```
