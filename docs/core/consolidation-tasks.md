PROGRESS TRACKING:

1. Shared Services Layer:
✓ Unified service interfaces defined
✓ Video service implementation complete
✓ Speech service implementation complete
✓ Provider abstraction implemented
✓ Error handling standardized
- Model management integration (In Progress)
- Caching layer (Pending)
- Monitoring setup (Pending)

2. UI Components Migration:
✓ Base styling system implemented
✓ Button component created
✓ Input component created
✓ Card component created
✓ Badge component created
✓ Layout component created
✓ Advanced components integrated
✓ Media controls integrated
✓ Character creation UI implemented
✓ Component tests completed

TOKEN MANAGEMENT:
- Current agent focused on services layer and documentation
- Next agent should continue with model management implementation
- Each task has clear entry/exit points for agent handoff
- Documentation updated with each completed step

DEPENDENCIES:
- UI Components completed ✓
- Shared Services required for Content Creation Features
- Documentation being updated incrementally ✓

This structure allows for:
1. Clear progress tracking
2. Efficient agent handoff
3. Token usage optimization
4. Parallel development where possible
