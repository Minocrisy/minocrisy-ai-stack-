IMPLEMENTING CLINE + GEMINI COLLABORATION

1. IMMEDIATE SETUP STEPS

ENVIRONMENT PREPARATION:
1. Ensure Cline API key in dev.nix
2. Enable Gemini in VSCode
3. Configure shared workspace
4. Verify tool access for both agents

WORKSPACE ORGANIZATION:
1. Create dedicated project directories
2. Set up shared configuration files
3. Establish documentation structure
4. Configure version control

2. INITIAL TEST TASKS

SIMPLE VERIFICATION:
1. Gemini: Create code snippet in editor
2. Cline: Save and test the code
3. Gemini: Revew and suggest improvements
4. Cline: Implement and verify changes

DOCUMENTATION TEST:
1. Gemini: Draft documentation in editor
2. Cline: Save as .txt files
3. Gemini: Review saved content
4. Cline: Manage file organization

3. TASK DISTRIBUTION SETUP

DEVELOPMENT TASKS:
- Gemini: Code suggestions, reviews
- Cline: File operations, testing
- Both: Error handling, optimization

DOCUMENTATION TASKS:
- Gemini: Content creation, review
- Cline: File management, organization
- Both: Accuracy verification
