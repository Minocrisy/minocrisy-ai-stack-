- Text-to-speech functionality integrated
- Video generation with multiple providers
- Speech recognition with multiple providers
- API services layer completed with type safety
- Context providers implemented for all services
- Multi-provider architecture established
- Service interfaces standardized
- Media playback controls implemented
- Character creation workflow established
- Testing infrastructure in place
- First component tests implemented

NEXT STEPS:
1. Additional Component Tests:
   - CharacterCreator component tests
   - ModelSelector component tests
   - Service integration tests
   - Context provider tests
   - End-to-end workflow tests

2. Documentation:
   - Component usage guides
   - API integration guides
   - Provider configuration
   - Testing guidelines
   - Development workflow

3. Optimization:

TOKEN USAGE NOTE:
When continuing this task, a new agent should:
1. Implement remaining component tests
2. Create documentation
3. Optimize performance
4. Update this progress file after each major task

DEPENDENCIES NEEDED:
- All required API services are implemented
- Context providers are in place
- Component-specific dependencies to be added as needed
- Media playback libraries as required
- Testing frameworks installed and configured

This progress report provides context for the next agent to continue the UI component migration efficiently.
