DOCUMENTATION REORGANIZATION PLAN

CURRENT ISSUES:
1. Duplicate Environment Documentation
2. Overlapping Development Guides
3. Scattered Main Documentation
4. Backup Files Everywhere

PROPOSED STRUCTURE:

/docs/

│   ├── quick-start.md             # (moved from vision/)
│   ├── architecture.md            # (moved from vision/)
│   ├── use-cases.md              # (moved from vision/)
│   └── project-structure.md       # (moved from vision/)
│

│   ├── development/              # Development Documentation

└── improvements/                   # Project Improvements
    ├── current-progress.txt      # (keep for active tracking)

MIGRATION STEPS:

1. Create New Structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/{core,guides/{development,environment}}
   ```

2. Move and Merge Files:
   - Move vision/ contents to core/
   - Merge environment docs
   - Merge development guides
   - Remove duplicates

3. Update References:
   - Fix internal documentation links
   - Update tool paths
   - Update git tracking

4. Clean Up:
   - Remove .backup files
   - Remove empty directories
   - Remove test/ directory

5. Update Documentation:
   - Update table of contents
   - Fix cross-references
   - Update file paths in examples

BENEFITS:
1. Clear Organization:
   - Logical grouping
   - Reduced duplication
   - Better navigation

2. Improved Maintenance:
   - Single source of truth
   - Easier updates
   - Clear ownership

3. Better User Experience:
   - Clear entry points
   - Logical progression
   - Easy to find information

NEXT STEPS:
1. Create pull request with reorganization
2. Update documentation tools
3. Update progress tracking
4. Remove backup files
5. Test all documentation links

This reorganization will make the documentation more maintainable and easier to navigate while eliminating duplicates.
