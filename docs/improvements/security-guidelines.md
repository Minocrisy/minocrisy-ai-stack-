ENHANCED SECURITY GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES

1. CREDENTIAL PROTECTION

AUTOMATED SCANNING:
- Pre-commit hook configuration for credential pattern detection
- Regular automated scans of template files
- Pattern matching for common credential formats
- Immediate notification of potential exposures

ROTATION PROCEDURES:
- 90-day rotation schedule for all API keys
- Immediate rotation on suspected exposure
- Automated rotation notification system
- Verification procedures post-rotation

2. TEMPLATE SAFETY

VALIDATION CHECKS:
- Automated scanning for credential patterns
- Format verification for placeholder values
- Structure consistency checks
- Version control integration

PRE-COMMIT PROCEDURES:
- Block commits containing credential patterns
- Verify template formatting
- Check for sensitive data patterns
- Validate environment variables

3. AUDIT PROCEDURES

REGULAR AUDITS:
- Weekly automated scans
- Monthly manual reviews
- Quarterly comprehensive audits
- Annual security assessment

AUDIT CHECKLIST:
□ Template files contain only placeholders
□ No real credentials in documentation
□ .gitignore rules are comprehensive
□ Local credential files are protected
□ Environment variables are secure
□ Access controls are current
□ Backup procedures are tested
□ Recovery procedures are verified

4. INCIDENT RESPONSE

EXPOSURE HANDLING:
1. Immediate credential rotation
2. Access log review
3. Impact assessment
4. System security review

RECOVERY STEPS:
1. Revoke exposed credentials
2. Generate new credentials
3. Update local configurations
4. Verify system security
5. Document incident and response

5. BEST PRACTICES

- Template modifications

ALERT SYSTEM:
- Immediate notification of security events
- Escalation procedures
- Response tracking
- Resolution verification

7. COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION

REGULAR CHECKS:
