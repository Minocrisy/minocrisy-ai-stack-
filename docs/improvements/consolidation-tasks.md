YOGI ECOSYSTEM CONSOLIDATION PLAN

1. SHARED SERVICES LAYER
Task ID: services_001
Type: code_development
Description: Create shared services architecture
Components:
- API integrations (Groq, Replicate, ElevenLabs)
- Media services (from tellet)
- Model management
Status: Pending

2. UI COMPONENTS MIGRATION
Task ID: ui_001
Type: code_development
Description: Migrate and standardize UI components
Components:
- Base components from YOGI.v2
- Advanced components from yogi-ui
- Media controls from yogicast
Status: In Progress (Current agent working on base components)

3. CONTENT CREATION FEATURES
Task ID: content_001
Type: code_development
Description: Integrate content creation capabilities
Components:
- Podcast generation from yogicast
- Video processing from tellet
- Character creation from yogi-ui
Status: Pending

4. DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
Task ID: tools_001
Type: code_development
Description: Integrate development tools
Components:
- CLI capabilities from yogi-engineer
- Code analysis tools
- Project management features
Status: Pending

5. DOCUMENTATION
Task ID: docs_001
Type: documentation
Description: Create comprehensive documentation
Components:
- Architecture overview
- API documentation
- Component usage guides
Status: Pending

PROGRESS TRACKING:
1. UI Components Migration:
- ✓ Base styling system implemented
- ✓ Button component created
- ✓ Input component created
- ✓ Card component created
- ✓ Badge component created
- ✓ Layout component created
Next Steps:
- Integrate advanced components from yogi-ui
- Add media controls from yogicast
- Implement character creation UI

TOKEN MANAGEMENT:
- Current agent focused on UI component migration
- Next agent should continue from "Next Steps" in UI Components Migration
- Each task has clear entry/exit points for agent handoff
- Documentation updated with each completed step

DEPENDENCIES:
- UI Components must be completed before Content Creation Features
- Shared Services required for all other components
- Documentation should be updated incrementally

This structure allows for:
1. Clear progress tracking
2. Efficient agent handoff
3. Token usage optimization
4. Parallel development where possible
